## What did you do right?    
I created a website that will allow students to access the content to learn about Algorithms and Data Structures in C#.    
## What did you do wrong?    
I did not complete the videos or the code editor.    
## Where were you lucky?    
I was lucky that I found a way to scaffold the Models, Views, and Controllers from a database I created. This made CRUD operations with the database very easy to modify.    
## What would you change / What do you know now that you wish you knew "then"?  
I would have create a solid outline of the project and got the frontend development completed sooner to focus on the code editor for a much longer period. Too much time was wasted on making the project look a certain way, when I could have just created a simple website and focused on the more complex code editor and the content I wanted to share.
