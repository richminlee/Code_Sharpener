                My name is Richard Lee, I spent the last 11 years in the Army as a production control Supervisor. As a Production control supervisor, I managed the scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of 41 aircraft and the work priority of about 150 mechanics.

                One of my System administers told me I would be great at programming and introduced me to JavaScript. From there, As soon as I completed my tour in Iraq, I signed up for a coding bootcamp, and was sitting inside Coding Dojo’s classroom within 3 weeks of getting home. I enjoyed learning three different languages in three months, but felt like I wanted to get really good at C#, my favorite of the three. I found Microsoft Software and systems academy, that taught C# and the associated technologies for 19 weeks, and signed up.

                At Microsoft software and systems academy, I learned about c#, asp.netcore 3.1, Transact SQL, and azure. I also learned a lot about how the professional world develops software such as Agile methodologies and test driven development.
