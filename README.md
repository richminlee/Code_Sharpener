### Concept Description
* After researching throughout the internet, I found a lack of information on Algorithms and Data Structures solved in C#.
* For a person that chooses to learn C# as their first programming language, it would be more difficult to understand Algorithms and Data Structures in another language.
* I have decided to create a website that will explain concepts and walkthrough code utilizing the C# programming language.
* There will be two videos and multiple challenges for each chapter. 
* Each chapter will focus on a key concept.
* At the bottom of every chapter, there will be an embeded code editor with challenges and test cases so users can practice the chapter's key concept.
